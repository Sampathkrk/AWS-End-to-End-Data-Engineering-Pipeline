# 🧠 AWS End-to-End Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **data engineering pipeline** built using **AWS services** such as **S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight**.  
The goal of this project is to extract, transform, and analyze data efficiently using a modern cloud-based architecture.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The project follows a typical **ETL workflow**:
1. **Data Ingestion** – Upload raw data into an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. **Data Transformation** – Use AWS Glue (PySpark ETL script) to clean, format, and transform data.
3. **Data Querying** – Use Amazon Athena to query processed data directly from S3 using SQL.
4. **Data Visualization** – Build interactive dashboards in Amazon QuickSight to visualize insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Amazon S3** – Data storage (raw & transformed datasets)  
- **AWS Glue** – Serverless ETL for data transformation  
- **Amazon Athena** – Query service for analyzing data directly in S3  
- **Amazon QuickSight** – Business intelligence and visualization  
- **Python (PySpark)** – Data transformation scripting language  
- **SQL** – Used for analytical queries in Athena

## 🧪 Results

- Processed dataset stored in S3 (Parquet format)
- QuickSight dashboard created for business insights

## 🧰 Future Improvements

- Integrate AWS Lambda for event-driven automation  
- Add AWS Step Functions for workflow orchestration  
- Automate report delivery via AWS SNS or SES
